        You have no idea how much you made my senior high school lighter. You were always there for me, and I appreciate you soooo muuuuch from the bottom of my heart. You are so kind and patient with me that it's making me wonder how you were raised. Like fr.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
        You are one of the toughest people I know. Oh, how I hope that it wasn't because of how life treated you so poorly. But no matter how sturdy you are, reach out to me when life weighs you down. We may no longer be classmates, but I can ditch my class just to run to you. So, pleaseee don't solo your struggles.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
        I know how much life made you compromise your dreams and interests. It's making me cry that it seems like yesterday lang when you were talking about the college program you'd want to take. So, I hope all the beeeest thingsss happen to you. I hope that life softens for you. I genuinely do.Naiiyak talaga ko while typing this huhu. Love you so much talaga.
        </p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
        I also wish for you to find people that will care for you wholeheartedly. But don't enjoy their company that much, baka makalimutan mo 'ko. Charet. BUT, in all seriouness, Kriz, find people that can reciprocate the way you treat them. Don't let them abuse your kindess. Ako lang pwede gunawa noon 'di ba? Juk juk juk. 
         </p>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
        And, please, for the last timeee!!! Don't distance yourself from us. It breaks my heart whenever you do that. Weeeee are yourrr friendsss, and we'll always look out for you. :<

        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; margin-left: 2%; margin-right: 2%;">
         I wish that you have no more blue birthdays. I love you sooo much, Kriz.

        happiest birthday, krizz ! grabe, i keep saying this pero you're the person i've known the longest that i still consider a best friend, and that means so so SO much to me. i really didn't expect we'd become this close, especially after elementary when nag divert ang paths natin, but i'm so glad they crossed again kasi you're seriously one of the best friends i've ever had. i know you've had painful experiences in the past and while that should have made you bitter, you became kinder and gentler towards people because of it and you've developed a different kind of empathy that not many people have. i will admit, i wish i could have been a better friend for you during our shs times, kasi i can read when you're not okay, you wear your heart on your sleeves e, pero most times, nahihiya lang din talaga akong i-comfort or samahan ka. pero siguro ang wish ko na lang talaga is for the universe to give you the friends that we couldn't be and i hope that you've gotten them. i also hope that the universe becomes kinder to you, since it's been so cruel. dapat lahat ng paghihirap mo, maipasa kay sara duterte at bbm e. pero seriously, you've truly made a mark in my life kahit na hindi ko 'yun pinapakita or sinasabi. i'm so incredibly grateful you're here and i can't wait til we grow old at makita ko na lahat ng bunga ng paghihirap mo. you're the most talented person i know. your abilities should be celebrated, rather than taken advantage of. and sana, and i mean this in the most genuine way, but sana that soft and sensitive krizz doesn't change just because of this cutthroat world. i hope that you succeed without having to set aside your feelings and being cold, kasi that makes you truly you. i love you so much and i can't wait to hang out again. HAPPIEST BIRTHDAY KRIZZZZ
