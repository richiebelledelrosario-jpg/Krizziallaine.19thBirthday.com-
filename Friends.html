<h1> How Chie and Kriz Became Friends </h1>

<p> <strong>  Story Time! </strong> </p>
<p style="font-size: larger;"> <strong>  Our First Interaction</strong> </p>
<p> Kriz was new to our school, but almost everyone knew her name already. Why? Because she was the valedictorian of Pag-asa Elementary School! She used to be our schoolmate. When I saw her name on our class list, I was instantly thrilled to know she would be my classmate. </p>
<p> Fast-forward, we finally had the chance to sit beside each other. She was sooooo quiet, so I offered her a piece of my Bluetooth earbuds, thinking that she might be feeling OP to the noise of our section. After she declined my offer, I thought maybe we really just don't match each other and will never be friends. </p>
<p> NOT UNTILLLL, an activity in Pre cal happned! We had to draw something on a Cartesian plane using very specific points, and it was a total disaster for me. T-T I'm so bad at drawing! It was so bad, I couldn't even recognize Naruto at all. Thenn, she came-my guardian angel! Before the next class with Ma'am Ico, I asked for her help. Keep in mind, lottttsss of my classmates asking for her help too; she has a lot in her hand. But she helped me first. :> I was sooo touched haha. Thanks to her, I was able to pass my activiy.  </p>

<p style="font-size: larger;"><strong> FRIENDS!</strong></p>
<p> This is the christmas party of 11-A Ptolemy. The time our friendship ignited! I hope she still remeber how many pictures she took me that day. We weren't even super close yet, but she was soooo incredibly patient with me. I think that moment made it clear in my mind and heart that she is indeed a friend of mine and that she is someone I must keep. She's the nicest!   </p>
<p> Plus, I have never met anyone who puts so much effort into the exchange gift (she was my monita) like she does! I still have all the cute clips she gave me. mwuah :> </p>

<p style="font-size: larger;"><strong> Oh bwelo, 2 months hindi nag usap </strong> </p>
<p> But, of course, friendship is not always perfect. It's just like how we don't always have sunny days! For two whole months, we didn't talk to each other. The Recognition Party, and releasing of grades went by, but neither of us budged. I remember seeing her cry during first few days that I ignored her. Guilt was eating me up, but my pride stood taller, so I did not reached out to her T-T. I did her so bad huhu. I am still sorry up to this day. I couldn't even remember now what made me tampo that much. </p>
<p> We made up after she reached out to me. She sent me a long message expressing how our fight hurts her. And that hit me; I was such a bad friend. I swore to never do it again. Thank you so muchh, Krizzyy for having that much understanding of me! </p>

<h2> And That's It!</h2>
<p>  Our friendship taught us a lot of lessons that we will bring to the new people that we'll meet. </p>
